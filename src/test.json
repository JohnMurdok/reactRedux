The Rails team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @eileencodes (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nThis repository is being automatically checked for code quality issues using <a href=\"https://codeclimate.com\">Code Climate</a>. You can see results for this analysis in the PR status below. Newly introduced issues should be fixed before a Pull Request is considered ready to review.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html) for more information.\n"

Pull request #26869 removed the error message check in that test because the error message changed in the mysql2 gem, which caused the test to fail. Now the test wouldn't catch the original bug since the\r\nNoMethodError would get turned into a ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid exception.\r\n\r\nCheck the cause of the StatementInvalid exception to make sure it is of the correct type.",

        "body": "@boazy reported in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/16919#issuecomment-263035188 that the following code may fail (success depends on the current time):\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nActiveSupport::Duration.parse(2.months.iso8601) == 2.months\r\nActiveSupport::Duration.parse(3.years.iso8601) == 3.years\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution is make duration parsing independent of any moment of time and just assign fixed values of seconds to each duration part (as it's really done in methods like [`2.days`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L45-L47)).\r\n\r\nI have not used suggested solution with `total_seconds += value.send(part.to_sym)` as it will create many intermediate durations, slowing down parsing and littering memory. Instead I've added a part-to-seconds mapping hash constant to durations itself.\r\n\r\nFailing regression test is included.\r\n\r\nDuration parsing got 1.5x faster: https://gist.github.com/Envek/d0763db337d34ef78bf8d0a1aceca9aa\r\n\r\nr? @pixeltrix \r\n\r\n### P.S>\r\n\r\nMethods like beforementioned `2.days` can be changed to use this constant too, this will speed up them, move all magic duration constants in single file and constants and eliminate creation of a bunch of intermediate durations. Now calling [`2.years`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/integer/time.rb#L25-L27) will call [`365.25.days`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L45-L47) which in turn will call [`24.hours`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L37-L39) which in turn will [create duration for `2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600` seconds](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L21-L23) from which seconds will be taken and all 3 intermediate durations will be thrown. I can change them too in this or separate pull request.\r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ndef years\r\n  ActiveSupport::Duration.new(self * 365.25.days.to_i, [[:years, self]])\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill become\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ndef years\r\n  ActiveSupport::Duration.new(self * ActiveSupport::Duration::PARTS_IN_SECONDS[:years].to_i, [[:years, self]])\r\nend\r\n```"

        "body": "@boazy reported in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/16919#issuecomment-263035188 that the following code may fail (success depends on the current time):\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nActiveSupport::Duration.parse(2.months.iso8601) == 2.months\r\nActiveSupport::Duration.parse(3.years.iso8601) == 3.years\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution is make duration parsing independent of any moment of time and just assign fixed values of seconds to each duration part (as it's really done in methods like [`2.days`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L45-L47)).\r\n\r\nI have not used suggested solution with `total_seconds += value.send(part.to_sym)` as it will create many intermediate durations, slowing down parsing and littering memory. Instead I've added a part-to-seconds mapping hash constant to durations itself.\r\n\r\nFailing regression test is included.\r\n\r\nDuration parsing got 1.5x faster: https://gist.github.com/Envek/d0763db337d34ef78bf8d0a1aceca9aa\r\n\r\nr? @pixeltrix \r\n\r\n### P.S>\r\n\r\nMethods like beforementioned `2.days` can be changed to use this constant too, this will speed up them, move all magic duration constants in single file and constants and eliminate creation of a bunch of intermediate durations. Now calling [`2.years`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/integer/time.rb#L25-L27) will call [`365.25.days`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L45-L47) which in turn will call [`24.hours`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L37-L39) which in turn will [create duration for `2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600` seconds](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L21-L23) from which seconds will be taken and all 3 intermediate durations will be thrown. I can change them too in this or separate pull request.\r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ndef years\r\n  ActiveSupport::Duration.new(self * 365.25.days.to_i, [[:years, self]])\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill become\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ndef years\r\n  ActiveSupport::Duration.new(self * ActiveSupport::Duration::PARTS_IN_SECONDS[:years].to_i, [[:years, self]])\r\nend\r\n```"

        "body": "@boazy reported in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/16919#issuecomment-263035188 that the following code may fail (success depends on the current time):\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nActiveSupport::Duration.parse(2.months.iso8601) == 2.months\r\nActiveSupport::Duration.parse(3.years.iso8601) == 3.years\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution is make duration parsing independent of any moment of time and just assign fixed values of seconds to each duration part (as it's really done in methods like [`2.days`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L45-L47)).\r\n\r\nI have not used suggested solution with `total_seconds += value.send(part.to_sym)` as it will create many intermediate durations, slowing down parsing and littering memory. Instead I've added a part-to-seconds mapping hash constant to durations itself.\r\n\r\nFailing regression test is included.\r\n\r\nDuration parsing got 1.5x faster: https://gist.github.com/Envek/d0763db337d34ef78bf8d0a1aceca9aa\r\n\r\nr? @pixeltrix \r\n\r\n### P.S>\r\n\r\nMethods like beforementioned `2.days` can be changed to use this constant too, this will speed up them, move all magic duration constants in single file and constants and eliminate creation of a bunch of intermediate durations. Now calling [`2.years`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/integer/time.rb#L25-L27) will call [`365.25.days`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L45-L47) which in turn will call [`24.hours`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L37-L39) which in turn will [create duration for `2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600` seconds](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7f19f30819dd5a5a788ad9d8b12b5dda76559a12/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L21-L23) from which seconds will be taken and all 3 intermediate durations will be thrown. I can change them too in this or separate pull request.\r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ndef years\r\n  ActiveSupport::Duration.new(self * 365.25.days.to_i, [[:years, self]])\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill become\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ndef years\r\n  ActiveSupport::Duration.new(self * ActiveSupport::Duration::PARTS_IN_SECONDS[:years].to_i, [[:years, self]])\r\nend\r\n```"
