# React-Redux Project

This is my first project using ReactJS with Redux.
The exercise consists in developing a client-side React page that takes as input at least:
• a Github stream URL (such as https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/events or https://api.github.com/events)
• a pair of dates

This page should display these events in a table, and filter them according to the the inputs (e.g. between too dates).

Requirements:
• Written in React
• Use Redux

### Installation

React-Redux project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.
Then clone the repository into your computer.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnMurdok/ingimaProject.git
```
Install the dependencies and devDependencies

```sh
$ cd reactRedux
$ npm install
```

### Start with the application

On reactRedux directory:

```sh
$ npm run start
```
The client listens port 3000 (for BrowserSync 3001 too)
